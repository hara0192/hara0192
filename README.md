The people I work with would describe me as a problem solver who never shy away tackling a problem heads on. 
Be it an architectural discussion or an existing production issue. I enjoy diving right into it and love seeing it to the end. 
I am also a quick learner. I try to keep myself updated with the current tech stack. Be it a new cloud framework or a frontend/backend technology. 
I believe in growing as a team. I enjoy spending time in group discussions and mentoring as well.

I strongly believe "Skill is a passion driven vehicle !"
